In this project I plan to build a simple 8-bit computer based on the 6502 microprocessor. 
I will be using the design created by Ben Eater (eater.net/6502) as a starting point
for my design and plan to add additional features and modifications to the design.

Ben's design is very simple, with a 2x8 character display for output, and a few push 
buttons for input. I would like to add more IO functionality to this. For my project
I would like to modify the design to include a larger display that can show multiple
lines of text and simple graphics. In addition to a better display I want this 
computer to be able to interface with a full sized keyboard. These improved peripherals
will probably interface with the 6502 processor directly through the 6522 or may need to
implement some sort of serial communication through SPI, I^2C, etc. 

Although this project is mostly based in assembly I would like to use this project
to practice programming in C. After finalizing the hardware design I plan to work more
on the software. I would like to write a simple operating system for
this computer based on my work in CS3650 Computer Systems. In addition I want to 
experiment whith programming simple games like pong and tetris. I think this could be
a good challenge since this computer will be extremely limited resources when compared
to the modern computers I am used to developing with.
