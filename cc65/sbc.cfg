# This file contains a description of the hardware design

# MEMORY MAP
# ZP and RAM are subject to change if memory
# space needs to be reserved I/O drivers.

# ZP:       0x0000 - 0x00FF, 0x100
# STACK:    0x0100 - 0x01FF, 0x100
# RAM:      0x0200 - 0x6FFF, 0x6E00
# I/O:      0x7000 - 0x7FFF, 0x1000
# ROM:      0x8000 - 0xFFFF, 0x8000

# MEMORY defines how addresses that the 6502 can see relate to
# the different hardware devices
